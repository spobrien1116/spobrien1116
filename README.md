- Hello, my name is Shawn O'Brien

- I’m interested in learning as much as possible about the world of technology, and especially about programming. The last time I took a programming class was with
  C++ back in high school. I've worked and studied in many different fields, but I want to start my new career as a software developer on a strong foot.

- Currently I am taking a back end programming course with Promineo Tech, where I am learning about Java, MySQL, and Spring Boot. So far so good!

- Java is certainly new to me, but I am enjoying getting a feel for programming all over again. If anyone is looking for help on a fun pet project of theirs, I would
  certainly enjoy the experience of working with new code. Looking to start up a side project of my own once I learn more of the basics of Java.
