- Hello, my name is Shawn O'Brien

- I’m interested in learning as much as possible about the world of technology, and especially about programming. The last time I took a programming class was with
  C++ back in high school. I've worked and studied in many different fields, but I want to start my new career as a software developer on a strong foot. Some time has     passed, and I've since received my certificate of completion for the back-end programming boot camp through Nashua Community College with Promineo Tech.

- Currently I am taking a front-end programming course with Promineo Tech, which will cover topics such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, AJAX, any many others. I am happy to be back at it again learning helpful tools for my future.

- It is fun getting a feel for programming all over again. If anyone is looking for help on a fun pet project of theirs, I would
  certainly enjoy the experience of working with new code. Looking to start up a side project of my own once I learn more of the basics of Java.
